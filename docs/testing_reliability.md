## Contract Tests

- Node â†’ Rust with fixed CSVs (golden outputs)

## Snapshot Tests

- Plots hashed with SHA256

## Load Tests

- Parallel renders with different specs

## Security & Perf

- Input validation both Node + Py
- Limit max rows (downsample large)
- Enforce timeouts and graceful errors
